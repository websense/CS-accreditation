There will be a justification for the program founded on the needs of stakeholders, including
employers, graduates and the student intake; international curricula relevant to the programâ€™s field
of education and practice; and comparisons with programs of a similar nature available nationally or
internationally.

Show coherence of title, objectives, components and structure.   Explaining:
\begin{enumerate}
\item is related to needs of future stakeholders (ICT industry and community)
\item responds to international curricula
\item compares with programs of a similar nature nationally or internationally
\item embodies good program design practices from current academic literature
\item embodies trends in professional practice
\end{enumerate}
Provide a link to docs that justifies the program (recent prog review).  

TODO Links to further docs about the program that may assist the panel to evaluate its fit with its professional environment.  ACM, IEEE curricula and SWEBOK, BABOK, CYBOK etc.

\newpage
\section{Criterion B. Professional ICT Role and Skills}
\rubric{For each named major or specialisation in the program (or for the program itself where there is no major), identify the primary ICT professional role that a graduate is equipped to perform on graduation. While aspirational roles (such as CIO, project manager) have a purpose in indicating a career path for graduates, the professional role identified here will be one to which the graduate is immediately suited. If necessary, one further role may be listed.

The SFIA skills required to fulfil the ICT professional role (or roles) will be specified. Normally there
would be {\bf 2 primary SFIA skill areas in a particular professional role}. Subjects in the program which
{\bf assess} these skills will be {\bf mapped} to demonstrate that graduates achieve the underlying skills at SFIA
level 3 (or above).

\rubric{Review the requirements for advanced ICT knowledge to address complex computing in the
Accreditation Manual, Volume 2, Criterion D.\\
In the table below:\\
Identify subjects that are assessed at an advanced level that are targeted specifically at the
professional role identified for this program ({\bf exclude} the advanced subjects used in
Criterion E).
Identify the assessment item(s) that assess ICT knowledge at an advanced level e.g., at least
Blooms level 4). Note that quizzes, exams, practicals, etc do not count. The assessment
item must involve the solution of a complex problem with few directions as to the
solution approach and would typically have a weighting of at least 25\% of the subject
total
Then explain in no more than 50 words which Seoul Accord criteria of complex computing are
addressed by each such assessment item (see Criterion D in Volume 2 Criteria of the
Accreditation Manual).
A program will have at least 4 advanced subjects, 
counting no more than 2 breadth-based subjects (E - but see above exclude capstone from list),
at least 2 depth-based subject of ICT discipline-specific knowledge directly related to the professional role and SFIA for the program (so not project management or ethics units).

Numbers in the right column refer to  {\bf Complex Computing Criteria}:
(1) involves wide-ranging or conflicting technical, computing, and other issues;
(2) has no obvious solution, and requires conceptual thinking and innovative analysis to
formulate suitable abstract models;
(3) a solution requires the use of in-depth computing or domain knowledge and an analytical
approach that is based on well-founded principles;
(4) involves infrequently encountered issues;
(5) is outside problems encompassed by standards and standard practice for professional
computing;
(6) involves diverse groups of stakeholders with widely varying needs;
(7) has significant consequences in a range of contexts;
(8) is a high-level problem possibly including many component parts or sub-problems;
(9) identification of a requirement or the cause of a problem is ill defined or unknown.
