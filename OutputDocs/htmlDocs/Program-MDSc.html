<h5>Justification of Program</h5>
<p>The Master of Data Science (MDS) equips students with the analytical and computational skills necessary to develop data-driven solutions and navigate the evolving landscape of data science. The program introduces systematic approaches to collecting, processing, analysing, visualising data, and applying data science techniques to solve real-world problems across various domains. It is a conversion program designed for students and professionals who hold a tertiary degree in a discipline other than data science (such as arts, science, marketing, finance, or business) and seek to develop specialist skills in data science and analytics. It provides an entry pathway for individuals looking to transition into data science careers. </p><p>The MDS program structure consists of units in three categories. The 4-unit conversion sequence builds foundational skills in programming, database management, and statistical analysis, ensuring students have the right technical base for further study. The 5-unit core sequence covers the data science life cycle and its principles, as well as foundational units, including machine learning and statistical learning. It also includes a capstone group project where students apply their skills in a practical setting. The electives allow students to tailor their learning experience in three domains. At least three units are chosen from a selection of four ICT electives including data warehousing, cloud computing, and high-performance computing. At least three units are chosen from a selection of eight data analysis ICT electives including deep learning, natural language processing, research topics on data science and computationally intensive methods in statistics. Students can also select a unit from a broader elective group, offering flexibility to explore interdisciplinary applications or professional development opportunities. For instance, the program includes opportunities for industry engagement through work-integrated learning (WIL), offering structured internships with not-for-profit, community, and government organisations locally, regionally, and globally. Selection for the WIL unit is based on an interview with industry clients. Additionally, high-achieving students (WAM 70+) may undertake a two-unit research project, providing a pathway into PhD studies or other industry opportunities. This program is designed to meet the growing industry demand for skilled data professionals, ensuring that graduates are prepared to work across diverse sectors, including business, healthcare, media, science, and government.</p><p>Graduates of the Master of Data Science  will have completed at least 14 ICT units and up to 2 ICT-related units comprising  4 mandatory ICT conversion units, 5 mandatory ICT core units, at least 3 ICT  units from option A, at least 2 ICT units from option B and at most 2 ICT or ICT-related units from options B and C.</p>

This involves selecting the appropriate AWS SDKs, and implementing solutions that meet specific requirements for scalability, security, and performance. Security and Encryption where security measures are implemented and managed in cloud-based applications. For example, they apply IAM policies, create and use KMS keys for encryption, and ensure secure API access, which are important for designing secure AWS applications. Scalability and Performance where AWS application scalability is achieved by configuring load balancing (e.g., with AWS Application Load Balancer) and optimizing DynamoDB performance. DevOps Practices: Students use Fabric for automating deployments with AWS CLI and SDKs to streamline the deployment and management of cloud resources.  Analyze trade-offs between security, scalability, and performance when designing solutions, ensuring that the system meets the intended goals.</td>

Students have developed these competencies through the sequence CITS1401, CITS1402, CITS2002 or CITS2005.<br><br>Students develop skills in SFIA SWDN (level 3) by developing scalable, secure, and efficient cloud-based applications. Main activities involve: Software Design where cloud applications are designed using AWS services and frameworks, such as deploying web applications with Django and integrating databases like DynamoDB. This involves selecting the appropriate AWS SDKs, and implementing solutions that meet specific requirements for scalability, security, and performance. Security and Encryption where security measures are implemented and managed in cloud-based applications. For example, they apply IAM policies, create and use KMS keys for encryption, and ensure secure API access, which are important for designing secure AWS applications. Scalability and Performance where AWS application scalability is achieved by configuring load balancing (e.g., with AWS Application Load Balancer) and optimizing DynamoDB performance. DevOps Practices: Students use Fabric for automating deployments with AWS CLI and SDKs to streamline the deployment and management of cloud resources.  Analyze trade-offs between security, scalability, and performance when designing solutions, ensuring that the system meets the intended goals. (SFIA knowledge)<br><br>In the written and practical assessments, students analyse alternatives such as EC2 vs. ECS, client-side encryption vs. KMS integration and VPC/CIDR/security-group/port strategies, evaluate DynamoDB access/partition hot-spot metrics, KMS vs. local AES performance overheads, availability/rollback checks, and cost estimates/optimisations (compute, storage, bandwidth, logging) and create end-to-end automation, such as from ECR image build, ECS deploy, Django app, nginx/ALB, S3/DynamoDB, IAM/KMS security baseline, SageMaker training and Hyperparameter Tuning, to integration of AWS NLP/Computer Vision services. During this process, they need to provide design justifications, monitoring evidence, and exception/rollback procedures. (analyse, evaluate, create assessments Bloom levels 4, 5, 6)<br><br>In the laboratory assignments, students perform comprehensive analysis, such as choosing between EC2 and ECS (with ECR images) for the Django service, justifying autoscaling strategies, and selecting VPC/CIDR, routing, and security-group configurations, where there is no obvious solution and trade-offs must be reasoned about (1,2). They apply in-depth domain knowledge by enforcing IAM least-privilege with scoped roles for S3/DynamoDB/ECS tasks, configuring KMS key policies, implementing nginx/ALB health checks with timeout policies, and planning SageMaker job resources and parallelism (3). Students must address security–cost–operability trade-offs, such as client-side AES vs KMS-backed encryption, balancing latency/throughput overheads against key isolation and auditability, sizing ALB + nginx replicas for resilience, and tuning DynamoDB RCU/WCU and access patterns to balance cost and read/write latency (1,6). Each lab builds on the previous one, increasing complexity and requiring the integration of lectures with practical skills to solve a complex cloud problem, consisting of many component parts, with specified requirements that students must address (8).  (Complex computing criteria)</td>
