<h5>Justification of Program</h5>
<p>The Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) is a specialist 4-year degree designed to produce graduates who demonstrate the knowledge, technical capability and practical skills relevant to the contemporary world of engineering. The program is built around the Engineers Australia Stage 1 Competencies for Professional Engineers and integrates course content with work integrated learning, co-curricular activities, and professional skills development. The specialisation in Software Engineering provides students with a deep understanding of the software development process, coding and design skills and project management capabilities required in software engineering. The  17core  ICT units in the specialisation include the core units of the Computer Science major including algorithms, data structures, databases computer networks and web development. At level 4 and 5 the program builds on this foundation with a focus on practical aspects of software engineering, including requirements elicitation, software quality and testing, and project management. The Software Engineering major at UWA has been designed to provide you with a solid foundation in software requirements, design, implementation, testing, and professional engineering standards. It also includes advanced topics in cloud and high performance computing and a 1-year (2 unit) capstone design project.</p><p>Graduates of the Bachelor of Engineering [Honours] (Software Engineering) will have completed : 17 ICT units, 5 ICT-related engineering units, 4 supporting maths, physics and statistics units, 4 Engineering practice units (0 credit), and a 2-unit ICT research project.</p>

The unit builds on students' prior programming and data management experience to develop and demonstrate technologies in action. Students design, code, verify, and deploy web applications using a range of technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, jQuery, Bootstrap, Python (Flask), SQLAlchemy, and SQLite. This builds upon their previous experience acquired in prerequisite course such as CITS1401 (Computational Thinking with Python) and CITS1402 (Relational Database Management Systems). The group project requires them to build their own full-stack web application, and their responsibilities include selection of frameworks, designing web APIs, implementing authentication and security mechanisms, testing and finally deploying the application. Students work in groups of four, review both their own and their peers' code via the version control system Git, and provide regular formal project deliverables and demonstrations to the course facilitators.</td>

During the project, students review their own work and colleagues' work.  These skills are assessed in the group project deliverables and through individual professional conduct.  Students develop these skills through the sequence including CITS1401, CITS1003, CITS2200, CITS2005, CITS3403,  CITS3301, CITS3501 and GENG5505.</td>

This involves selecting the appropriate AWS SDKs, and implementing solutions that meet specific requirements for scalability, security, and performance. Security and Encryption where security measures are implemented and managed in cloud-based applications. For example, they apply IAM policies, create and use KMS keys for encryption, and ensure secure API access, which are important for designing secure AWS applications. Scalability and Performance where AWS application scalability is achieved by configuring load balancing (e.g., with AWS Application Load Balancer) and optimizing DynamoDB performance. DevOps Practices: Students use Fabric for automating deployments with AWS CLI and SDKs to streamline the deployment and management of cloud resources.  Analyze trade-offs between security, scalability, and performance when designing solutions, ensuring that the system meets the intended goals.</td>
