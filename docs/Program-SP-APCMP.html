<h5>Justification of Program</h5>
<p>The Master of Information Technology (MIT) equips students with advanced IT skills.  The MIT introduces systematic approaches to select, develop, apply, integrate and administer secure computing technologies  to enable users to accomplish their personal, organizational, and societal goals. The conversion program is designed for students and professionals who have a tertiary degree in another discipline (such as arts, science, marketing, finance, or business) and who seek to develop specialist skills in computing and software engineering. It is designed for students and returning professionals who wish to change direction or expand their skill set to pursue a career in IT. The MIT comprises 16 units (at least 12 ICT units) in 4 groups: Conversion, Core, Specialisation and Electives.  The 4-unit Conversion provides foundational skills in programming, database and cybersecurity.  The 4-unit IT Core comprises software requirements and design and web development, a philosophy unit on communication skills and  computing ethics and a capstone group project.  The Electives include a WIL unit, offering structured, quality internships with not-for-profit, community and government organisations locally, regionally, and globally.  Students are selected for the WIL unit based on interview with the industry clients.  The Electives also include a 2-unit research project for students (prerequisite WAM 70+)  offering a pathway from the MIT into PhD studies and cutting-edge industries.  The MIT has three Specialisations: AI, Software Systems and Applied Computing.  These Specialisations introduced in 2025 formalise unit selections that many students were already choosing from the more flexible prior structure of the MIT. </p><p>Applied Computing is a flexible specialisation, allowing students to choose 4 ICT specialist units according to their particular interests. The Applied Computing specialisation provides its graduates with the necessary knowledge and skills to explain and apply appropriate information technology (IT) methodologies to help an individual or organisation achieve its goals and objectives. Students also learn to appreciate the scientific foundations on which IT are built, and to anticipate the changing direction of IT and evaluate and communicate the effectiveness of new technologies.  When choosing their 4 specialisation units, students must choose at least 2 advanced level-5 ICT units.</p><p>Graduates of each of the specialisations of the Master of Information Technology course will have completed at least 11 ICT and 1 ICT-related units comprising: 4 foundation ICT units (with a choice between 2 units at level 2) taken by students with a non-cognate undergraduate degree, 3 compulsory core ICT units and one core ICT-related communications and ethics unit, 4 specialist core ICT units, and  4 elective units selected from 17 level 4 and 5 ICT units (including a WIL unit)  and 6 ICT-related elective units.</p>

The project requires them to contribute to the selection of the software development methods, tools, techniques, and security practices, and apply agreed standards, tools, and security measures to achieve well-engineered outcomes. During the project, students review their own work and colleagues' work.  These skills are assessed in the group project deliverables and through individual reflections, professionalism and peer assessment. Students develop these skills through the sequence including CITS1401, CITS1003, CITS2005 or CITS2002, CITS4401, and CITS5505.</td>

The unit builds on students' prior programming and data management experience to develop and demonstrate technologies in action. Students design, code, verify, and deploy web applications using a range of technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, jQuery, Bootstrap, Python (Flask), SQLAlchemy, and SQLite. This builds upon their previous experience acquired in prerequisite course such as CITS1401 (Computational Thinking with Python) and CITS1402 (Relational Database Management Systems). The group project requires them to build their own full-stack web application, and their responsibilities include selection of frameworks, designing web APIs, implementing authentication and security mechanisms, testing and finally deploying the application. Students work in groups of four, review both their own and their peers' code via the version control system Git, and provide regular formal project deliverables and demonstrations to the course facilitators.</td>

This involves selecting the appropriate AWS SDKs, and implementing solutions that meet specific requirements for scalability, security, and performance. Security and Encryption where security measures are implemented and managed in cloud-based applications. For example, they apply IAM policies, create and use KMS keys for encryption, and ensure secure API access, which are important for designing secure AWS applications. Scalability and Performance where AWS application scalability is achieved by configuring load balancing (e.g., with AWS Application Load Balancer) and optimizing DynamoDB performance. DevOps Practices: Students use Fabric for automating deployments with AWS CLI and SDKs to streamline the deployment and management of cloud resources.  Analyze trade-offs between security, scalability, and performance when designing solutions, ensuring that the system meets the intended goals.</td>

It also involves managing interactions between constrained devices, communication protocols, databases, developing back-end and front-end during the project.  Students apply software design principles, such as the MVC pattern for the front end and event-driven architecture for the backend, while evaluating various IoT security and authentication mechanisms for their application. They identify, assess, and recommend design alternatives and trade-offs as they develop a prototype, which serves as their final deliverable.  During the project presentation, students analyse both functional and non-functional requirements, present multiple design perspectives, and justify their final design choice. Based on their prototype, they further assess and suggest potential design improvements. Throughout the unit, students build these skills progressively, applying concepts learned during the labs to their project.</td>

Students have developed these competencies through the sequence CITS1401, CITS1402, CITS2002 or CITS2005.<br><br>Students develop skills in SFIA SWDN (level 3) by developing scalable, secure, and efficient cloud-based applications. Main activities involve: Software Design where cloud applications are designed using AWS services and frameworks, such as deploying web applications with Django and integrating databases like DynamoDB. This involves selecting the appropriate AWS SDKs, and implementing solutions that meet specific requirements for scalability, security, and performance. Security and Encryption where security measures are implemented and managed in cloud-based applications. For example, they apply IAM policies, create and use KMS keys for encryption, and ensure secure API access, which are important for designing secure AWS applications. Scalability and Performance where AWS application scalability is achieved by configuring load balancing (e.g., with AWS Application Load Balancer) and optimizing DynamoDB performance. DevOps Practices: Students use Fabric for automating deployments with AWS CLI and SDKs to streamline the deployment and management of cloud resources.  Analyze trade-offs between security, scalability, and performance when designing solutions, ensuring that the system meets the intended goals. (SFIA knowledge)<br><br>In the written and practical assessments, students analyse alternatives such as EC2 vs. ECS, client-side encryption vs. KMS integration and VPC/CIDR/security-group/port strategies, evaluate DynamoDB access/partition hot-spot metrics, KMS vs. local AES performance overheads, availability/rollback checks, and cost estimates/optimisations (compute, storage, bandwidth, logging) and create end-to-end automation, such as from ECR image build, ECS deploy, Django app, nginx/ALB, S3/DynamoDB, IAM/KMS security baseline, SageMaker training and Hyperparameter Tuning, to integration of AWS NLP/Computer Vision services. During this process, they need to provide design justifications, monitoring evidence, and exception/rollback procedures. (analyse, evaluate, create assessments Bloom levels 4, 5, 6)<br><br>In the laboratory assignments, students perform comprehensive analysis, such as choosing between EC2 and ECS (with ECR images) for the Django service, justifying autoscaling strategies, and selecting VPC/CIDR, routing, and security-group configurations, where there is no obvious solution and trade-offs must be reasoned about (1,2). They apply in-depth domain knowledge by enforcing IAM least-privilege with scoped roles for S3/DynamoDB/ECS tasks, configuring KMS key policies, implementing nginx/ALB health checks with timeout policies, and planning SageMaker job resources and parallelism (3). Students must address security–cost–operability trade-offs, such as client-side AES vs KMS-backed encryption, balancing latency/throughput overheads against key isolation and auditability, sizing ALB + nginx replicas for resilience, and tuning DynamoDB RCU/WCU and access patterns to balance cost and read/write latency (1,6). Each lab builds on the previous one, increasing complexity and requiring the integration of lectures with practical skills to solve a complex cloud problem, consisting of many component parts, with specified requirements that students must address (8).  (Complex computing criteria)</td>

It also involves managing interactions between constrained devices, communication protocols, databases, developing back-end and front-end during the project.  Students apply software design principles, such as the MVC pattern for the front end and event-driven architecture for the backend, while evaluating various IoT security and authentication mechanisms for their application. They identify, assess, and recommend design alternatives and trade-offs as they develop a prototype, which serves as their final deliverable.
