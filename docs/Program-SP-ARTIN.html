<h5>Justification of Program</h5>
<p>The Master of Information Technology (MIT) equips students with advanced IT skills.  The MIT introduces systematic approaches to select, develop, apply, integrate and administer secure computing technologies  to enable users to accomplish their personal, organizational, and societal goals. The conversion program is designed for students and professionals who have a tertiary degree in another discipline (such as arts, science, marketing, finance, or business) and who seek to develop specialist skills in computing and software engineering. It is designed for students and returning professionals who wish to change direction or expand their skill set to pursue a career in IT. The MIT comprises 16 units (at least 12 ICT units) in 4 groups: Conversion, Core, Specialisation and Electives.  The 4-unit Conversion provides foundational skills in programming, database and cybersecurity.  The 4-unit IT Core comprises software requirements and design and web development, a philosophy unit on communication skills and  computing ethics and a capstone group project.  The Electives include a WIL unit, offering structured, quality internships with not-for-profit, community and government organisations locally, regionally, and globally.  Students are selected for the WIL unit based on interview with the industry clients.  The Electives also include a 2-unit research project for students (prerequisite WAM 70+)  offering a pathway from the MIT into PhD studies and cutting-edge industries.  The MIT has three Specialisations: AI, Software Systems and Applied Computing.  These Specialisations introduced in 2025 formalise unit selections that many students were already choosing from the more flexible prior structure of the MIT. </p><p>The Artificial intelligence specialisation equips students with skills and knowledge to understand, evaluate, design and implement artificial intelligence systems with hands-on practice in a variety of contemporary artificial intelligence techniques, from machine learning and deep learning to natural language processing and adaptive systems that can learn from, and adapt to, a changing and unknown environment. Students develop in-demand skills and leadership qualities for an exciting career in AI.   </p><p>Graduates of each of the specialisations of the Master of Information Technology course will have completed at least 11 ICT and 1 ICT-related units comprising: 4 foundation ICT units (with a choice between 2 units at level 2) taken by students with a non-cognate undergraduate degree, 3 compulsory core ICT units and one core ICT-related communications and ethics unit, 4 specialist core ICT units, and  4 elective units selected from 17 level 4 and 5 ICT units (including a WIL unit)  and 6 ICT-related elective units.</p>

This builds upon their previous experience acquired in prerequisite course such as CITS1401 (Computational Thinking with Python) and CITS1402 (Relational Database Management Systems). The group project requires them to build their own full-stack web application, and their responsibilities include selection of frameworks, designing web APIs, implementing authentication and security mechanisms, testing and finally deploying the application. Students work in groups of four, review both their own and their peers' code via the version control system Git, and provide regular formal project deliverables and demonstrations to the course facilitators.</td>
