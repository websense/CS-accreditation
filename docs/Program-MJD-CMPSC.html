<h5>Justification of Program</h5>
<p>The Computer Science majortaken in the Bachelor of Science or the Bachelor of Philosophy [Honours]  provides students with the knowledge and skills required to directly contribute to the application and analysis of computing technologies in industry and society.  Through the 12 ICT units of the major graduates attain deep knowledge of theoretical, algorithmic, implementation and systems’ principles that underpin databases, programming languages, and internet-based systems. The Computer Science major covers what may be thought of as traditional computer science. The major has a strong emphasis on models of computation, programming, and systems from both a theoretical and a practical standpoint.</p><p>Graduates of the Bachelor of Science (Computer Science) will have completed 12 ICT units: 11 mandatory ICT units and 1 level-3 elective chosen from 6 ICT units (including a WIL unit) in the Computer Science major.  In addition </p>

The unit builds on students' prior programming and data management experience to develop and demonstrate technologies in action. Students design, code, verify, and deploy web applications using a range of technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, jQuery, Bootstrap, Python (Flask), SQLAlchemy, and SQLite. This builds upon their previous experience acquired in prerequisite course such as CITS1401 (Computational Thinking with Python) and CITS1402 (Relational Database Management Systems). The group project requires them to build their own full-stack web application, and their responsibilities include selection of frameworks, designing web APIs, implementing authentication and security mechanisms, testing and finally deploying the application. Students work in groups of four, review both their own and their peers' code via the version control system Git, and provide regular formal project deliverables and demonstrations to the course facilitators.</td>

They analyse correctness, complexity, efficiency and apply problem-solving techniques to achieve a well engineered result. (SFIA knowledge) <br>In the written and practical assessments students analyse and evaluate advanced algorithms, and use problem-motivated design to create novel algorithms (Analyse, evaluate, create assessments Bloom levels 4,5,6).<br>In the project they address complex computing problems through challenging algorithm design questions that involve abstracting a problem and developing a novel algorithm from first principles (Criteria 2,3,4,5,8).  The project assessment requires students to solve novel algorithmic problems to a high degree of mathematic rigour. This requires a good knowledge of algorithms and the tools of complexity and correctness analysis. It also involves conceptual and abstract thinking to apply these to an unseen problem. It can also involve creativity to extrapolate these foundations into new ways to approach problems. (Complex computing criteria)</td>

<p>Undergraduate students learn about professional practice throughout their degree.  Learning activities include guest lectures from industry, research essays, reflective practice, and extra-curricular events including club-run events such as Industry Insights.  Students complete a final-semester, team-based project conducted in conjunction with a real industry client, together with industry-led workshops on professional skills, providing a structured learning experience to prepare graduates for professional practice. Undergraduate students may also choose the internship-based work integrated learning unit CITS3009 as an elective. CITS3009 supports students to apply, enhance, and develop generic and/or specific skills gained through their Computer Science studies in an industry context.</p>
