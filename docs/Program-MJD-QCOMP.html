<h5>Justification of Program</h5>
<p>The Bachelor of Advanced Computer Science (Honours) (BACS) is a four-year integrated honours degree for high achieving students who have attained an ATAR of at least 92 and a pass in ATAR Maths Methods (or the UWA equivalent MATHS1721). There is a progress requirement for BACS of a weighted average mark of at least 70 to progress to the honours year.  BACS is structured on 4 components: a Computer Science core (12 units); advanced study of a specialist discipline through a major leading to an honours year with research project (10-12 units); contextual knowledge such as philosophy and ethics for AI (2-4 units); and free electives (4-6 units). BACS graduates are equipped for industry or academic research roles, to start-up new technology companies, and to contribute at an advanced level to the many businesses looking to harness the potential of AI, Data Science, Cybersecurity and Quantum Computing.  The Computer Science core of BACS develops knowledge of the principles of computation and information that underpin the computing software and systems that are revolutionising the world in which we live, work and communicate.   </p><p>In the Quantum Computing major students  learn strong computing and quantum computing skills through foundational building to advanced units. Students  study algorithms, computer systems, high performance computing, physics, maths, cybersecurity, and philosophy.</p><p>Graduates of the Bachelor of Advanced Computer Science [Honours] (Quantum Computing) will have completed: 16 mandatory ICT units, 1 level-3  elective chosen from 3 ICT units (including a WIL unit), 5 Physics and supporting Maths units,  and a 4-unit ICT research project.</p>

This builds upon their previous experience acquired in prerequisite course such as CITS1401 (Computational Thinking with Python) and CITS1402 (Relational Database Management Systems). The group project requires them to build their own full-stack web application, and their responsibilities include selection of frameworks, designing web APIs, implementing authentication and security mechanisms, testing and finally deploying the application. Students work in groups of four, review both their own and their peers' code via the version control system Git, and provide regular formal project deliverables and demonstrations to the course facilitators.</td>
